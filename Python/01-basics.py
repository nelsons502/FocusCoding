# Output
# # in python, we can create output using the `print()` command
print("Hello World") # This will print "Hello World" to the console

# Variables
# Variables are used to store data
# In python, we can create variables using the following syntax:
# variable_name = value
# Example:
name = "John Doe" # This will create a variable called `name` and assign the value "John Doe" to it
age = 25 # This will create a variable called `age` and assign the value 25 to it
# we can print out variables
print(name) # This will print "John Doe" to the console
print(age) # This will print 25 to the console
# there are different data types in python
# - int: integer
# - float: floating point number
# - str: string
# - bool: boolean
# there are more, but these are the basic ones
# let's experiment with them
num = 10 # this is an integer
pi = 3.14 # this is a float
is_true = True # this is a boolean
# we can print them out
print(num) # This will print 10 to the console
print(pi) # This will print 3.14 to the console
print(is_true) # This will print True to the console
# When we want to combine them with strings, we can use the `str()` function to convert the other data types
print("The value of num is " + str(num)) # This will print "The value of num is 10" to the console
print("The value of pi is " + str(pi)) # This will print "The value of pi is 3.14" to the console
print("The value of is_true is " + str(is_true)) # This will print "The value of is_true is True" to the console

# Input
# In python, we can get input from the user using the `input()` function
# Example:
name = input("Enter your name: ") # This will get the user's input and store it in the variable `name`
print("Hello " + name) # This will print "Hello" followed by the user's input to the console

# Operators
# In python, we can perform math operations using math operators
# - addition: +
# - subtraction: -
# - multiplication: *
# - division: /
